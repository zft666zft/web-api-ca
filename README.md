## Security and Authentication

### Authentication and Security Details

The `AuthContextProvider` in `authContext.js` manages the authentication state of the application using several key functions that interact with backend API and local storage. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Token Management**:
   - **Local Storage**: Upon successful login, the authentication token received from the server is stored in the browser's local storage using the `localStorage.setItem("token", data)` method. This token is then used for maintaining user sessions and is likely included in subsequent API requests to authenticate user actions.
   - **Token Retrieval**: When the context provider initializes, it attempts to retrieve an existing token from local storage (`localStorage.getItem("token")`), which helps in maintaining user sessions across page reloads.

2. **Authentication Functions**:
   - **`authenticate`**: This function is triggered during the login process. It calls the `login` API, passing the username and password. If the login is successful (i.e., a token is received), the token is saved both in local storage and state, and the user's authenticated status is updated to `true`.
   - **`register`**: During user registration, this function calls the `signup` API with the username and password. Depending on the response (`result.code`), it returns `true` for a successful registration (HTTP status code 201) and `false` otherwise. Note: It doesnâ€™t automatically log the user in or handle the authentication token during registration.

3. **Sign Out**:
   - **`signout`**: This function clears the authentication state and effectively logs the user out. It's a simple implementation that sets `isAuthenticated` to `false` after a short delay, without clearing the token from local storage which could be considered an area to improve for enhanced security.

### Protected Routes
The details from `authContext.js` and `protectedRoutes.js`confirm the mechanisms used to protect routes, as shown in the main application router configuration (`react-movies/src/index.js`). Routes that require user authentication are wrapped in a `ProtectedRoutes` component, which would utilize the `isAuthenticated` state to determine if the user should be granted access or redirected.


## Integrating with React App

### Integration of the React App with the API

#### Process Explanation
Integration process is set up in such a way that the React application communicates with the backend (Node.js), which in turn fetches data from the TMDB API and possibly stores or processes this data before sending it to the frontend. Here's how it's organized:

1. **Backend**:
   - **Fetching Data from TMDB**: The backend uses the `tmdb-api.js` to make HTTP requests to the TMDB API. It fetches various data such as movies, movie details, genres, etc., based on the routes accessed by the frontend.
   - **Serving Data to Frontend**: In api, routes are defined to handle requests from the frontend. These routes call the appropriate functions from `tmdb-api.js` to fetch data from TMDB and then return this data to the frontend in response to API calls.

2. **Frontend**:
   - **API Calls to Backend**: The frontend makes HTTP requests to the backend instead of directly fetching from TMDB. This is done through a modified `tmdb-api.js` on the frontend that points to backend server (`http://localhost:8080/api`).
   - **Usage of Data in Views**: The data fetched from these API calls is used to render different views and components in React application.

#### Views Using the Web API instead of TMDB API Directly

All views in React app now interact with Web API, which acts as a middleware between the TMDB API and frontend. This means any data regarding movies, genres, recommendations, etc., are requested from backend, not directly from TMDB.

### Updates to the React App from Assignment One

1. **Data Fetching**:
   - Changed the data fetching mechanism from directly querying TMDB to routing these requests through the backend. This modification is seen in the `react-movies\src\api\tmdb-api.js`, where the base URL now points to backend.

2. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Added `authContext.js`: Manages user authentication states and functions (login, registration, and sign out).
   - Added `loginPage.js` and `signUpPage.js`: Provides user interface for login and registration functionalities.
   - Added `protectedRoutes.js`: Controls access to certain routes based on authentication status, ensuring that some parts of the app can only be accessed by logged-in users.

3. **UI Components and Routing**:
   - Updated `siteHeader\index.js`: Likely to include links or navigation changes based on user authentication status.
   - Updated `index.js`: Includes routing configurations that integrate the newly added protected routes and authentication context.


## Independent learning (if relevant)

1. Learn to use the axios library.

2. Create new MongoDB collection added along with multiple related endpoints.

3. Integrate frontend and backend.

4. Use css to beautify pages.
